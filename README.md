# Information Security with HelmetJS - BCrypt

This project focuses on the use of bcrypt, a password-hashing library that securely encrypts user credentials using salting and key stretching. This way, it ensures passwords are stored in a way that resists brute-force attacks. Additionally, it allows for asynchronous and synchronous methods to hash and compare passwords efficiently in various authentication workflows.  In it, the following was accomplished:

- Securely hash passwords using bcrypt with salting.
- Compare hashed passwords against user input to verify authentication securely.
- Implement both asynchronous and synchronous bcrypt methods to understand performance differences.
